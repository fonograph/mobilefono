            Jumpalot Junkbot started life in a much simpler form as the product of a <a href="http://www.tojam.ca">TOJam</a>. Over the following year, I refined the concept and released the result as an iPhone game.
            The game is a fairly focused study in speed and angles, with unique controls that involve spinning the world around your character, as it bounces and careens of obstacles at high velocities.

            As a little side bonus, the game also contains a short story describing the extinction of humanity (and fate of its garbage), as told through the short descriptions of the 100 types of space junk that comprise the game's collectables.
