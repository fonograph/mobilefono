            Funded by the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Ontario, Gaming Privacy was both a research project and a game development project. Through a series of workshops with 8-10 year olds,
            I and my colleagues aimed to ascertain children's perceptions of online issues, and co-create (with the children) a game that would help educate about these issues.
        </p>

            I led the game development portion of the project. Working with a team of 5, and inspired by the ideas generated by the kids in the workshops, we created a hybrid board game / iPad game.
            The main gameplay resides in the board game component, but the iPad app acts as a "dungeon master" of sorts, guiding the players, and conveying episodic story content that changes from
            game to game. The grant only funded development up to the prototype stage, but it is fully playable at <a href="watchersgame.com">watchersgame.com</a>.
