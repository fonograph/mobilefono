            Genome was an online tool that generated art using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm">generic algorithm</a>. In a nutshell: The system would generate random images
            from mathmetical expressions, a human would classify which images were most "desirable", and the algorithm would combine and mutate expressions that were part those images. This process was
            repeated indefinitely leading to the development of positive emergent characteristics, similar to the process of biological evolution. Genome also incorporated networking which allowed multiple
            users to share and evaluate a common pool of images.

            The images above are direct output from Genome, with absolutely no editing done to them. These are a sample of the several dozen final results that were produced.
            The app itself was developed as a Java applet over a decade ago, so it is of course long gone.
