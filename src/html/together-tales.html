    <div class="details">
        <p>Together Tales is a series of interactive books. Unlike other interactive books, the actual reading is done on paper; then, in between each chapter, there's an activity where the player enters the world of the story, and helps the characters remotely. Some activities are digital, and each book comes with a cross-platform app for those. Other activities take place offline, using physical artifacts that come in the same "adventure kit" as the book chapters. Both kinds of activities are orchestrated by the parent, who uses an online interface to customize the experience and drive the experience forward for their child.</p>
