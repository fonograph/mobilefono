        <p>The Home to Win website was produced as a companion to HGTV's show of the same name, and received over 1 million pageviews a month during the run of the show. In addition to featuring galleries, videos, and an audition submission system, the site also featured two cutting-edge interactive features. One, an immersive tour of the home, allowed the user to navigate through interactive 360-degree panoramas. The other, a "Design a Room" tool, allowed the user to modify those 360 environments, customizing dozens of large and small details, including paint, furniture, accessories, and more. This tool also offered a feature to immediately a generate a "reveal" video modeled after the show of the customized rooms, showing all their choices in a 3D rendered walkthrough. </p>
