            Produced for the ByteMe! Festival. The game brought together a number of locative technologies, all accessible through a player’s mobile, to turn the streets of Perth into a giant game board. Ghost Town showcased Perth’s public spaces in a new and exciting light.

            Ghost Town was a mashup of scavenger hunts, transmedia storytelling and mobile gaming. Players used their mobiles to communicate with ghosts imprisoned around town. To save the day, they had to solve a series of puzzles and locate a number of stickers hidden around town. Clues came in all shapes and sizes: pictures, recordings, SMS messages and even phone calls. The game led players through numerous venues, introducing them to some of the city’s hidden gems.

            Made in a time before smartphones were prevalent, Ghost Town utilized some very primitive mobile technologies in experimental ways.
