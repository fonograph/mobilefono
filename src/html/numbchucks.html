            9 Story was tasked with creating accessible but engrossing games for a young audience, to coincide with the launch of the Numb Chucks TV show.
            We created three: Hyper Street Dash is a side-scrolling endless runner, where the player can smash through a variety of objects using kung-fu moves.
            Epic Bowling effectively a top-down driving game, where the player steers a ball to hit pins and power ups along the course. And Fists of Punching is a retro homage
            to side-scrolling beat-em-ups in the vein of Streets of Rage.
        </p>
        <p>
            The games were developed in Flash / AS3.
