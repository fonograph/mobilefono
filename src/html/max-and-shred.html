            Stitch Media was tasked with creating accessible but engrossing games for a young audience, to coincide with the launch of the Max &amp; Shred TV show.
            We created two: Snowboard Challenge is a side-scrolling endless runner, where the player scores by hitting ramps and doing a variety of snowboard tricks in the air.
            Science Rush is a tower defense game based on the Plants vs Zombies model, where the player deploys a variety of high tech distractions to stop obnoxious teenagers.
        </p>
        <p>
            The games were developed in pure Javascript, using the Phaser and Pixi.js frameworks.
