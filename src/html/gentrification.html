            Gentrification: The Game is an award-winning transmedia game, which uses mobile technology to facilitate and augment offline gameplay. It has been presented at game and culture festivals around the world to critical acclaim. Small teams compete to collect real-world properties, “convert” them, and transform the neighbourhood. As developers, they’ll build swanky lofts, erect coffee shops, and raise property values. Or, as locals, they’ll form BIAs, make community centres, and try to thwart the developers. The neighbourhood’s changing face is tracked on a mobile web app, which updates along with players’ offline actions, and allows them to strategize while moving around. The same data is replicated on a giant sidewalk chalk map, which serves as a central meeting point, and looks <em>fabulous</em>.
