            You know that scene in Kill Bill where Uma Thurman takes on the Crazy 88 in an epic swordfight? This game is that scene. One swordmaster takes on a legion of nameless attackers, complete with music, sound cues, and flashing lights. It was built with foam swords, Playstation Move controllers, magnets, and a lot of velcro.
