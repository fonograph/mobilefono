            Using a separate tablet or phone, each player takes the role of either Morro or Jasp, a pair of clown sisters putting on a show they’re entirely unprepared for. The performance unfolds with each player choosing each and every line for their clown. With over 25,000 words of dialogue and 50 different endings, players have the opportunity to create a great show or a terrible one, through fights, reconciliations, romantic comedy, Shakespeare, drunkenness, Vaudeville acts, staring matches, lion attacks, and so on. Every playthrough is like co-creating a live performance, and since each one lasts only a few minutes, there’s ample opportunity to play together in a myriad of different ways.
