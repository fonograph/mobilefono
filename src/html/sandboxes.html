            Sandboxes was a prototype media sharing app I built and studied during a summer internship in Microsoft Research's Community Technologies Group.

            Created for very early smartphones, Sandboxes was an exploration into how media sharing could be a continuous, nuanced social experience as opposed to the simple "send & receive" operation
            that early mobile phones were restricted to. The "sandboxes" were shared spaces into which text, photos, video, audio, and comments could be posted, much as with today's mobile social
            applications. As a research project, Sandboxes was deployed to a select group of testers within Microsoft, and I analyzed their usage of it, writing the results into a peer-reviewed paper.
