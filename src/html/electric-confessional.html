            Electric Confessional was an interactive art installation that combined holographic projection, early-days face tracking and crowdsourced content. Participants would step onto a platform in front of a hanging pane of treated glass, and a camera would detect their face and begin the "confession" process. Confessions were randomly drawn from then anonymous confession website grouphug.us, and then projected onto the glass. For onlookers, this created the effect of overlaying the (often embarrassing) text on top of the person standing behind in the "booth". At the end of the experience, an image of the participant would be captured along with their random confession, and uploaded to the Electric Confessional website.
